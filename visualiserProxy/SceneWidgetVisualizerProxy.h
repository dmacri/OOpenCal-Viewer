/** @file SceneWidgetVisualizerProxy.h
 * @brief Template class for managing visualization of cell-based models.
 *
 * This file contains the SceneWidgetVisualizerTemplate class which provides
 * a bridge between the visualization system and cell-based models. It combines
 * a Visualizer instance with a ModelReader to handle the visualization of
 * grid-based cellular automata or similar models.
 * 
 * @details The Visualizer supports various models for visualization, each requiring
 * specific handling for its element type (Cell, which inherits from Element in OOpenCal).
 * Different models need dedicated file reading methods and specific visualization approaches.
 * This template class serves as a connector between model reading and its visualization,
 * providing a flexible way to handle various model types.
 *
 * For more architectural details, see: doc/CHANGELOG_RUNTIME_MODELS.md */

/** @class SceneWidgetVisualizerTemplate
 * @tparam Cell The cell type used in the model (must inherit from Element in OOpenCal)

 * @brief Template class that manages visualization of a grid-based model.
 * 
 * This class serves as a bridge between the visualization system and the underlying
 * model data. It combines a Visualizer for rendering with a ModelReader to load
 * and manage cell data, providing a complete solution for model visualization.
 * 
 * The template architecture allows for different model types to be visualized
 * using the same infrastructure, with each model providing its own Cell implementation
 * and corresponding ModelReader specialization.
 * 
 * @note The template parameter Cell must be a type that represents a single
 *       cell in the model and must inherit from Element (defined in OOpenCal).
 *       The ModelReader must be specialized for the specific Cell type to handle
 *       the model's file format and data structure. */
